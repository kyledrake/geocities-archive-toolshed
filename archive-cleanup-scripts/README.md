This is a continuation of cleanup scripts for the geocities.archiveteam.torrent scripts put together by Dragan Espenschied, available [here](https://github.com/despens/Geocities/tree/master/scripts/geocities.archiveteam.torrent) (though I recommend you use [my fork with some fixes](https://github.com/kyledrake/Geocities/tree/master/scripts/geocities.archiveteam.torrent)).

These scripts assume you have run the original scripts up to the move commands in 012-ingest.sh, but does not require the postgres database ingestion or the indexing (013). Do not run these scripts without doing that first!
